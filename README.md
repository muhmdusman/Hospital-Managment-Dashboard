## Vercel Deployment Guide

### Step 1 — Import Repository

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Select **Import Git Repository** → choose `muhmdusman/AppleMango-P2-DevCon`
3. Set **Root Directory** to `hospital-scheduler`
4. Framework preset will auto-detect **Next.js**

### Step 2 — Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in Vercel's project settings (**Settings → Environment Variables**):

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://toylldnsofltvidcoaep.supabase.co` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...QkQggcHQ...` | Supabase anon/public key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...YP1kji4t...` | Supabase service role key (server-side only) |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` | `MedScheduler` | Relying party display name |
| `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` | `apple-mango-p2-dev-con.vercel.app` | Your Vercel domain (no protocol) |
| `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` | `https://apple-mango-p2-dev-con.vercel.app` | Full origin URL with `https://` |

> **Important:** For production, update `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` to your actual Vercel domain and `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN` to the full `https://` URL. These must match exactly for biometric login to work.

### Step 3 — Deploy

1. Click **Deploy** — Vercel will build and deploy automatically
2. After first deploy, update Supabase Auth settings:
   - Go to **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration**
   - Add your Vercel URL to **Redirect URLs**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/**`

### Step 4 — Verify

1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Register a new account or use test credentials below
3. Seed demo data via **Settings → Seed Demo Data**

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 16.1.6** (App Router) — SSR, server actions, Turbopack
- **React 19** — concurrent rendering, transitions
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** — accessible, composable component library (New York style)
- **@hello-pangea/dnd** — drag-and-drop calendar scheduling
- **Chart.js + react-chartjs-2** — analytics bar/line charts
- **Sonner** — toast notifications
- **Lucide React** — icon library

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** — database, auth, real-time subscriptions
- **Supabase Auth** — email/password + WebAuthn biometric authentication
- **Supabase Admin API** — server-side user management (magic link session creation)
- **Server Actions** — Next.js server actions for all CRUD operations

### Security
- **WebAuthn / FIDO2** — biometric fingerprint/face login via `@simplewebauthn/browser` + `@simplewebauthn/server`
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — 5 roles (Admin, Manager, Surgeon, Scheduler, Nurse)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** — PostgreSQL policies on all tables
- **Web Crypto API** — AES-GCM encryption for offline cached data

### Offline Support
- **Service Worker** — cache-first for static assets, network-first for data
- **IndexedDB** — encrypted local storage of medical records
- **Background Sync API** — queues offline operations, syncs when back online
- **Session Persistence** — localStorage-based session caching for offline login
- **Conflict Resolution** — last-write-wins with timestamp comparison + merge

### AI/ML
- **Surgery Duration Prediction** — complexity-based regression model
- **Schedule Quality Scorer** — greedy optimizer with A-F grading
- **Equipment Failure Prediction** — usage-threshold analysis
- **Dynamic Priority Queue** — auto-escalation with aging factor

### Data Generation
- **@faker-js/faker** — realistic Pakistani names, ICD-10 procedure codes
- **60 unique patients** with randomized demographics (age, gender, BMI, ASA, comorbidities)
- **31 staff members** — 10 surgeons, 5 anesthesiologists, 10 nurses, 2 OR managers, 3 schedulers

### Deployment
- **Vercel** — hosting, CI/CD, edge network
- **GitHub** — version control, automated deployments

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Biometric login requires a WebAuthn-capable browser/device (Chrome, Edge, Safari with Touch ID/Face ID, Windows Hello).
- For production WebAuthn, the `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID` must match the deployed domain exactly.
- Offline mode stores a limited subset of records due to IndexedDB quota constraints.
- AI/ML models use lightweight heuristic approaches (not deep learning) due to hackathon time constraints; accuracy can be improved with real training data.
- Real-time notifications depend on active connection; push notifications are not implemented.
- The `middleware` file uses Next.js 16's deprecated convention (proxy-based middleware is recommended for future versions).

## AI/ML Model Details & Training Approach

| Model                        | Approach                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Surgery Duration Prediction** | Complexity-based regression formula using procedure type, complexity level (1–5), surgeon historical performance, patient age/BMI/comorbidities, and time-of-day fatigue factor. |
| **Schedule Optimization**       | Greedy priority sorting algorithm that scores schedule quality, identifies high-risk slots, and suggests optimal surgery sequences.                                             |
| **Equipment Failure Prediction**| Usage-threshold alerting system based on equipment usage hours and maintenance history to predict failures proactively.                                                          |
| **Dynamic Priority Queue**     | Real-time priority scoring with aging factor — surgeries waiting longer get escalated automatically. Emergency > Urgent > Elective with configurable weights.                    |

**Why heuristic over heavy ML?**
- Explainable, fast, and suitable for real-time operational decision-making.
- No external training pipeline or GPU required.
- Can be upgraded to Random Forest / Gradient Boosting with sufficient historical data (e.g., MIMIC-III dataset).
